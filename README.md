## Getting Started with Vite

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v20+ recommended (works with v18+ for Vite 5.x)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- **Tip:** Use [nvm](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) (Windows) or [nvm-sh/nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (macOS/Linux) to easily manage multiple Node.js versions on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/msmith1392/msmith1392.github.io.git
   cd msmith1392.github.io
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Development

Start the local development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Linting & Formatting

- Run `npx eslint .` to lint the codebase.
- Run `npx prettier --check .` to check formatting.
- Run `npx eslint . --fix` to automatically fix lint errors.
- Run `npx prettier --write .` to auto-format code.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production:

```sh
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory.

npm run deploy
```

## Environment Variables

- Environment variables should be prefixed with `VITE_` (e.g., `VITE_API_URL`) and accessed via `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`.

The contact form uses [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).  
You must set the following in your `.env` file (not committed to git):

```
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
VITE_EMAILJS_USER_ID=your_user_id
